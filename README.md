# Dogmatika Card Watch

## Summary

The goal of this program was to have price updates to a new archetype comming to the yugioh trading card game. Since the archtype is fairly new, there is a high posibility that the prices will be very volitatile. In order to find the best prices, I decided to create a simple python program that scrapes the result page of the dogmatika from tcgplayer and parses it for me. I also added the feature where the program will email me every hour for the name of the card and its price.

## Cool Stuff I learned while working on this program

- Web Scraping
- Javascript rending pages
- Parasing
- Emailing using python
    - Different type of files
- Better understanding of structure of HTML pages
